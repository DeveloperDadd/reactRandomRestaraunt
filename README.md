# Awesome Inc Web Developer Bootcamp React Template

This project was designed to give bootcampers of the Awesome Inc Web Dev Bootcamp a firsthand experience with React, in particular the useEffect and the useState hook. The project is entirely frontend and also gave us experience working with axios and fetching data from a backend API.
